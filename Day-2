Linear Regression:
There are many ways of predicting values for given dataset, the simplest one is linear regression. This model is used when the dataset are in the form of (xi,yi) scattered 
in the cartesian plot and job is to predict yi, for a given xi. The dataset can be simplified by drawing a line through the data which will predict our output given as 
y = mx + c  

some terminologies:
Training example: (xi , yi) i ->  represent row in a table of training set
input variable: x (feature)
output variable: y (target variable)
m : number of training example
