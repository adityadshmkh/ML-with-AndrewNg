**Visualising Cost function graph**
***
The primary objective of plotting a cost function graph is to know where does the minima of the graph lies, i.e. What should be the values of w,b so that, our model best fits the given data and predicts the data most closely.
The cost function graph can be plotted in three ways:
1. Generic manner: where you can see your data and the cost function graph at the same time, not a practical way of visualising.
2. Contour: In this method you can observe concentric ovels with two axes of w & b.
3. Grid view: This type of graph shows the w & b in two axes and the cost function on the third axes, which makes it visually easier to spot the minima(of cost function).
