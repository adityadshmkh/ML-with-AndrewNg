**Visualising Cost function graph**
***
The primary objective of plotting a cost function graph is to know where does the minima of the graph lies, i.e. What should be the values of w,b so that, our model best fits the given data and predicts the data most closely.
The cost function graph can be plotted in two ways:
1. Contour: In this method you can observe concentric ovels with two axes of w & b.
2. Surface view: This type of graph shows the w & b in two axes and the cost function on the third axes, which makes it visually easier to spot the minima(of cost function).

We cannot everytime make a graph and visualise a graph to find the values of w & b to find a best fit models, so for that we have different algorithms which do our job to find the values of w & b so that the model is best fit.
